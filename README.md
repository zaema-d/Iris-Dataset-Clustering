# Iris Dataset Clustering

## Overview
This project is part of my Data Science and Analytics internship at The Sparks Foundation. The goal is to predict the optimum number of clusters for the Iris dataset and represent it visually.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The samples are divided into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

## Methodology
The K-Means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the data into different groups. We experiment with different numbers of clusters (2, 3, and 4) to determine the optimum number.

## Results
The results are visualized using scatter plots, with each cluster represented by a different color. The plots are displayed side by side for easy comparison.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and the required packages (scikit-learn, Matplotlib) installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the Python script to generate the cluster visualizations.
